Additional precomputing to neural network. Does it work?

Neural nets map input to output with some computations in between. Usually, we feed clean data to the model. But what will we obtain if several precomputed features are also passed to the network with the raw data?
I wanted to see the difference in preliminary preparation of data that is already contained in the pure form. It seems that such help to the neural network does have a certain effect.
